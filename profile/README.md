# Welcome to the Cellular Semantics Team

Part of the Wellcome Sanger Institute’s Cellular Genetics Department, the Cellular Semantics Team is dedicated to advancing knowledge in cell classification and understanding cellular diversity. We specialize in developing and curating the Cell Ontology—a dynamic, structured vocabulary of cell types essential for accurate data integration and analysis in the life sciences.

Our team combines expertise in cell biology, bioinformatics, and ontology development to create precise and up-to-date definitions that support the growing fields of single-cell genomics, transcriptomics, neuroscience, and beyond. By collaborating with scientific experts worldwide, we ensure that the Cell Ontology remains a reliable resource for researchers looking to classify and analyze cellular data at scale. We are also major contributors to a suite of interconnected Open Biomedical Ontologies including the Uberon anatomy ontology.
